						<h2>My introduction to Coding</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						The first time I ever thought about doing anything about coding was
						when I was around 10 from my dad. My father is a self-taught
						programmer and he was always trying to encourage me to get into
						coding but I never had any real interest, even when he'd show me his
						work and try to explain it to me. When I looked at code it seemed
						inconceivable and very,
						<i>very</i> boring. Back then, anything &gt coding.

							This picture is basically what all code looked like to me, and
							ended up only hurting my head.

						The next experience I had with any sort of coding was when I decided
						to try and learn it using CodeCademy. Codecademy is a great site but
						I quickly found out that at around 11 years old, I wasn't the best
						at staying on track. I would just complete the assignments and not
						genuinely learn anything, however it wasn't as boring this time
						around. I ended up dabbling a little bit in html but that's as far
						as I got before I gave up again.

						Now I'm here, learning at CoderGirl and I've never thought about not
						sticking with coding for a second. I've put in all my effort to this
						class and it's paid off tenfold. Now I have real attainable plans
						for the future. Safe to say I no longer look at code and wish I were
						doing anythiing else like how I first was.
