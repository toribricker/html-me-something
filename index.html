   <h2>My introduction to Coding </h2>
</header>

<p>The first time I ever thought about doing anything about coding was when I was around 10 from my dad. My
father is a self-taught programmer and he was always trying to encourage me to get into coding but I 
never had any real interest, even when he'd show me his work and try to explain it to me. When I looked at code it seemed inconceivable and very, <i>very</i> boring.
Back then, anything &gt coding.

<p>The next experience I had with any sort of coding was when I decided to try and learn it using CodeCademy. Codecademy is a great site but I quickly found out that at around 11 years
   old, I wasn't the best at staying on track. I would just complete the assignments and not genuinely learn anything, however it wasn't as boring this time around. I ended up dabbling a
   little bit in html but that's as far as I got before I gave up again.

<p>Now I'm here, learning at CoderGirl and I've never thought about not sticking with coding for a second. I've put in all my effort to this class and it's paid off tenfold. Now I have
   real attainable plans for the future. Safe to say I no longer look at code and wish I were doing anythiing else like how I first was.
